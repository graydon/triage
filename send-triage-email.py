This week's triage assignment is %d bugs randomly divided between %d people,
based on their preferred weekly capacity. You have been assigned %d bugs.
Please make some time to look through your set and look for ways to move
the bugs forward:

  - Search for duplicates and close the less-clear one if found
  - Search for similar bugs and link them together if found
    (with a comment mentioning the #NNNN number of one bug in the other)
  - Check the tags, title and description for clarity and precision
  - Nominate for a milestone if it fits the milestone's criteria
  - Add testcases, narrow them down or attempt to reproduce failures
  - Provide suggestions on how to fix the bug
  - Modernize test cases
  - Can a newbie handle this bug? Tag it 'easy'!
  - Can a newbie not handle this 'easy' bug? Untag it!

And finally:

  - Actually try to fix the bug, if it seems within reach

Note: only after all the above has been attempted and no improvements can
be made then you may 'bump' the bug by leaving a comment such as 'bumping
for triage'.

We recommend using https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi for command-line
operations on bugs. If you have any questions about your assigned bugs,
please drop in to IRC and ask about them.

Your %d bugs for this week are:
